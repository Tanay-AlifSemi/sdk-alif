# Alif Semiconductor Zephyr SDK

Welcome to the Alif Semiconductor Zephyr SDK—a complete environment for application development on Alif's devices using Zephyr OS. This SDK includes Alif-specific code samples and the essential `west.yml` file, which manages all required modules and submodules for a full-featured development experience.

The SDK is tailored to help developers configure, build, and deploy real-time applications on Alif’s low-power, high-performance devices.

## Quick Setup

If you're already familiar with Zephyr RTOS, install it and run the following command in a clean directory of your choice:

```bash
west init -m https://github.com/alifsemi/sdk-alif.git; west update
```

If you're new to Zephyr, start by reviewing the [Introduction to Zephyr](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/introduction/index.html) for an overview. Then, refer to the [Getting Started Guide](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html) to begin development.
